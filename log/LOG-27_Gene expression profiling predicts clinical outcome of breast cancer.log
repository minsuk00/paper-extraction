    "method": "Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour. Gene expression profiling promises to improve prognosis and prediction of drug response. However, the complexity of gene expression data and the variability across different studies have made it difficult to validate molecular signatures linking cancer with clinical behaviour. Here we show that gene expression patterns of human breast tumours can be used to identify patients with clinically distinct outcomes. In a diverse set of breast tumours, we derived a specific gene expression 'poor-prognosis' signature that predicts disease outcome. This signature, which contains genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, outperforms existing methods for predicting survival in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, the genes in our signature provide new targets for therapy. The poor-prognosis signature was validated in four independent data sets. Furthermore, we show that the poor-prognosis signature is a general indicator of poor survival in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative) and could therefore redefine a subset of patients who might benefit from adjuvant therapy. Our results strongly support the idea that molecular signatures are as instructive as histopathological staging and can better reflect the underlying biology of tumours.",
    "result": "We analysed gene expression profiles of 295 samples of human breast tumours from patients with lymph-node-negative disease who had not received systemic adjuvant therapy. We identified a 'poor-prognosis' signature that was associated with a shorter interval to distant metastases (in particular, lung and brain metastases) and reduced overall survival. The poor-prognosis signature includes genes involved in cell cycle regulation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis, which are all potential targets for therapy. The signature was validated in four independent data sets, comprising a total of 710 patients. In all data sets, the signature was a strong predictor of the risk of distant metastases and death from breast cancer, independent of traditional clinical and pathological risk factors. The poor-prognosis signature was particularly effective in identifying patients at high risk of early metastasis and death within 5 years after diagnosis.",
    "conclusion": "Our study demonstrates that the gene expression profile of breast cancer can predict clinical outcome better than conventional prognostic factors. The 'poor-prognosis' signature we identified provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer progression and suggests new targets for therapy. The ability to identify patients at high risk of distant metastases and death could improve the management of breast cancer by enabling the selection of patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy, thereby potentially saving lives."
