    "method": "Breast tumour selection criteria\nThe criteria for the sporadic patients (n=97) were: primary invasive breast carcinoma less than 5cm (T1 or T2), no axillary metastases (N0), age at diagnosis less than 55 years, calendar year of diagnosis 1983–1996, all patients were treated by modified radical mastectomy (n=35) or breast-conserving treatment (n=62), including axillary lymph node dissection followed by radiotherapy. Five patients of the metastases group received adjuvant systemic therapy consisting of chemotherapy (n=3) or hormonal therapy (n=2), all other patients did not receive additional treatment. All patients were followed at least annually for a period of at least 5 years. The criteria for hereditary patients (n=20) were: carriers of a germline mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, and primary invasive breast carcinoma; no other selection criterion was applied. This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the Netherlands Cancer Institute. For complete patient data, see Table S1 in Supplementary Information.\nClinical parameters of breast tumours\nTumour material was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1h after surgery. A haematoxylin and eosin stained section was prepared before and after cutting slides for RNA isolation for assessment of the following: tumour type (according to the World Health Organization classification), histological grade (grade 1–3), and the presence of angioinvasive growth and extensive lymphocytic infiltrate. ER expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining (negative when less than 10% of the nuclei showed staining, all others ER positive). RNA isolation\nWe used 30 sections of 30-mm thickness for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated with RNAzolB, and finally dissolved in RNAse-free H2O. Twenty-five micrograms of total RNA treated with DNAse was dissolved in RNAse-free H2O to a final concentration of 0.5 mg ml−1. cRNA labelling\n cRNA was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 (CyDye, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A panel of approximately 20,000 monoclonal antibodies was generated and screened on Th1 and Th2 cell lines, including the established Th1-specific clone AE7 and in vitro differentiated Th1 and Th2 cell lines derived from 5B6 (ref. 19) and DO11.10 T-cell receptor transgenic mice. A panel of approximately 20,000 monoclonal antibodies was generated and screened on Th1 and Th2 cell lines, including the established Th1-specific clone AE7 and in vitro differentiated Th1 and Th2 cell lines derived from 5B6 (ref. 19) and DO11.10 T-cell receptor transgenic mice. Stable puromycin-resistant cells were stained with monoclonal antibody to Tim-3 (solid line) or rat IgG isotype control (dotted line). d, Total RNA from various cell lines and cells purified from SJL mice was isolated and transcribed to cDNA by reverse transcription, and cDNA was used for TaqMan PCR. The figure shows expression of Tim-3 RNA relative to control GAPDH expression.",
