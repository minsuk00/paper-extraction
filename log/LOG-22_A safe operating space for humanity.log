      "introduction": "Although Earth has undergone many periods of significant environmen-tal change, the planet\u2019s environment has been unusually stable for the past 10,000 years1\u20133. This period of stability \u2014 known to geologists as the Holocene \u2014 has seen human civilizations arise, develop and thrive. Such stability may now be under threat. Since the Industrial Revolution, a new era has arisen, the Anthropocene4, in which human actions have become the main driver of global envi-ronmental change5. This could see human activities push the Earth system outside the stable environmental state of the Holocene, with consequences that are detrimental or even catastrophic for large parts of the world.\nDuring the Holocene, environmental change occurred naturally and Earth\u2019s regu-latory capacity maintained the conditions that enabled human development. Regular temperatures, freshwater availability and biogeochemical flows all stayed within a rela-tively narrow range. Now, largely because of a rapidly growing reliance on fossil fuels and industrialized forms of agriculture, human activities have reached a level that could dam-age the systems that keep Earth in the desirable Holocene state. The result could be irrevers-ible and, in some cases, abrupt environmental change, leading to a state less conducive to human development6. Without pressure from humans, the Holocene is expected to continue for at least several thousands of years7.",
      "method": "To meet the challenge of maintaining the Holocene state, we propose a framework based on \u2018planetary boundaries\u2019 . These boundaries define the safe operating space for humanity with respect to the Earth system and are associated with the planet\u2019s bio-physical subsystems or processes. Although Earth\u2019s complex systems sometimes respond smoothly to changing pressures, it seems that this will prove to be the exception rather than the rule. Many subsystems of Earth react in a nonlinear, often abrupt, way, and are par-ticularly sensitive around threshold levels of certain key variables. If these thresholds are crossed, then important subsystems, such as a monsoon system, could shift into a new state, often with deleterious or potentially even disastrous consequences for humans8,9.\nMost of these thresholds can be defined by a critical value for one or more control vari-ables, such as carbon dioxide concentration. Not all processes or subsystems on Earth have well-defined thresholds, although human actions that undermine the resilience of such processes or subsystems \u2014 for example, land and water degradation \u2014 can increase the risk that thresholds will also be crossed in other processes, such as the climate system.\nWe have tried to identify the Earth-system processes and associated thresholds which, if crossed, could generate unacceptable envi-ronmental change. We have found nine such processes for which we believe it is neces-sary to define planetary boundaries: climate change; rate of biodiversity loss (terrestrial and marine); interference with the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles; stratospheric ozone depletion; ocean acidification; global fresh-water use; change in land use; chemical pol-lution; and atmospheric aerosol loading (see Fig. 1 and Table). \nIn general, planetary boundaries are values for control variables that are either at a \u2018safe\u2019 distance from thresholds \u2014 for processes with evidence of threshold behaviour \u2014 or at dangerous levels \u2014 for processes without evidence of thresholds. Determining a safe distance involves normative judgements of how societies choose to deal with risk and uncertainty. We have taken a conservative, risk-averse approach to quantifying our plan-etary boundaries, taking into account the large uncertainties that surround the true position of many thresholds. (A detailed description of the boundaries \u2014 and the analyses behind them \u2014 is given in ref. 10.)",
      "result": "Humanity may soon be approaching the boundaries for global freshwater use, change in land use, ocean acidification and interfer-ence with the global phosphorous cycle (see Fig. 1). Our analysis suggests that three of the Earth-system processes \u2014 climate change, rate of biodiversity loss and interference with the nitrogen cycle \u2014 have already transgressed their boundaries. For the latter two of these, the control variables are the rate of species loss and the rate at which N2 is removed from the atmosphere and converted to reactive nitrogen for human use, respectively. These are rates of change that cannot continue without signifi-cantly eroding the resilience of major compo-nents of Earth-system functioning. Here we describe these three processes.",
      "conclusion": "The evidence so far suggests that, as long as the thresholds are not crossed, humanity has the freedom to pursue long-term social and economic development."
