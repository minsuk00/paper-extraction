    "introduction": "The climate classification based on the work of Wladimir K¨oppen, and dating from 1900, continues to be the most widely used climate classification over a century later. Essenwanger (2001) has provided a comprehensive review of the classification of climate from prior to K ¨oppen through to the present. The period of greatest activity was from the mid-nineteenth century through to the 1950s. What is somewhat surprising about this time profile of activity is that as both the availability of data and computing power to process them has become increasingly widely available post-1960, the level of activity in the development of new climate classifications has markedly declined. The continued popularity and widespread use of the K ¨oppen classification is remarkable. There is no doubt an element of historical inertia in this as each generation of students is taught global climate using this system and it is the basis of most common global climate maps. To replace it with a new system would be a significant task. Arthur Wilcock (1968) was probably correct in surmising: \"If ....... one is convinced that there are in principle strict limits to what can be achieved by any simple classification, one may consider it profitless to seek minor improvements at the cost of confusion.\" (p. 13). K¨oppen’s inspiration for developing a world map of climate classification in 1900 owed much to the global vegetation map of Grisebach published in 1866 and K ¨oppen’s own background in plant sciences (Wilcock,1968). Thornthwaite (1943) claims that K ¨oppen’s use of the first five letters of the alphabet to label his climate zones is taken from the five vegetation groups delineated by the late nineteenth century French/Swiss botanist Alphonse De Candolle who in turn based these on the climate zones of the ancient Greeks. It is inconceivable that K ¨oppen could have produced his original classification and map without using other landscape signals of climate (particularly vegetation) since there would have been so little observed climate data available at that time. In Fig. 3 of this paper we show the relative number of stations with temperature and precipitation data starting from 1800. Compared with what is available now, there would have been data from few stations available to K ¨oppen and the global distribution would have been much more inconsistent than is the case now. In the light of this, the persistence of his scheme of classification is even more remarkable. While Sanderson (1999) has argued that it is time for modern atmospheric scientists to develop a new classification of climates, the K ¨oppen classification continues to be the one most widely used in teaching. If we take as an example the textbooks of Arthur Strahler that are in very wide use in the English speaking world, it is the case that despite Strahler’s own attempt to produce a new climate classification (see, for example, Strahler, 1971) the latest edition of this series of texts still uses the K ¨oppen system (Strahler and Strahler, 2005). The use of K ¨oppen’s classification is not confined to teaching. Many researchers routinely use it for their own particular research purposes. The present authors have used it as the basis for grouping rivers by climate type around the world in order to facilitate comparisons of runoff characteristics (McMahon et al., 1992; Peel et al., 2004). Lohmann et al. (1993) have applied the K ¨oppen classification to the output from both atmosphere general circulation models and coupled atmosphere-ocean circulation models and compared these to maps of the K ¨oppen classification using modern data sets and to K ¨oppen’s 1923 map. They modelled both present conditions and enhanced greenhouse scenarios and concluded: \"However, the K ¨oppen classification is easier to apply and is still a useful tool for estimating the ability of climate models to reproduce the present climate as well as indicate the impact of climate changes on the biosphere.\" (p.191) No doubt K ¨oppen would have been pleased with this assessment. In a similar study to that of Lohmann et al. (1993), Kalvova et al. (2003) compared global climate model outputs to maps of K ¨oppen’s classification drawn from gridded observed data and to K ¨oppen’s 1923 map. They were attracted to the K ¨oppen system because of its known links to natural vegetation patterns as they have attempted to assess the impact of global warming on major biomes. They also compare the map they produced of K ¨oppen’s climate zones based on modern data with his 1923 map and show that the differences are only around 0.5% of the area distribution. Similar uses of the K ¨oppen classification have been made by Wang and Overland (2004), Gnanadesikan and Stouffer (2006) and Kleidon et al. (2000) where it is the relation between the K ¨oppen zones and natural vegetation systems that has made it useful to their purposes. It is noteworthy that Kleidon et al. (2000) also used the K ¨oppen 1923 map as a basis for comparison. A more critical approach to the K ¨oppen classification has been taken by Triantafyllou and Tsonis (1994) who claim to be the first to evaluate the K ¨oppen classification using modern temperature and precipitation data (for the northern hemisphere). They classified climate stations on a year by year basis and then analysed the frequency with which they shifted between the major K ¨oppen climate types (e.g. A to B) in order to assess the adequacy of the K ¨oppen system. In North American and North Africa they found low variability within a climate type and narrow regions of high variability between climate types, indicating the K ¨oppen system performed adequately. For Europe and Asia they found the pattern of variability less defined, indicating either high within climate type variability or wide regions between climate types resulting in an inadequate performance of the K ¨oppen system. It is the case however that the K ¨oppen classification was intended to represent long term mean climate conditions and not year-to-year variability though it can be put to good use as the basis for assessing climate variability on a year-to-year (Dick, 1964) or multi-decadal basis (Gentilli, 1971). Triantafyllou and Tsonis (1994) conclude, with Sanderson (1999), that there is a need for a new scheme to represent the world’s climates. That may be so, but when Fovell and Fovell (1993) used cluster analysis to objectively determine climate zones for the conterminous United States based on modern climate data they returned to the K ¨oppen classification to assess the outcomes. Similarly Stern et al. (2000), with all the data resources of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology at their disposal, used a modification of the K ¨oppen classification to draw a new map of the climates of Australia. Their assessment that \"... the telling evidence that the K ¨oppen classification’s merits outweigh its deficiencies lies in its wide acceptance.\" (p. 2). It is against this background that we have chosen to redraw the K ¨oppen-Geiger world map using global long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station data. Recently, four K¨oppen world maps based on gridded data have been produced for various resolutions, periods and levels of complexity. Kalvova et al. (2003) using Climate Research Unit (CRU, the University of East Anglia) gridded data for the period 1961–1990 presented a map of the 5 major K ¨oppen climate types (with E divided into 2 types) at a resolution of 2.5◦latitude by 2.5◦longitude. Gnanadesikan and Stouffer (2006)presented a K ¨oppen map of 14 climate types based on the same CRU data and period as Kalvova et al. (2003), but at a resolution of 0.5◦latitude by 0.5◦longitude. Fraedrich et al. (2001) using CRU data for the period 1901–1995 presented a K ¨oppen map of 16 climate types at a resolution of 0.5◦latitude by 0.5◦longitude and investigated the change in climate types over the period 1981–1995 relative to the complete period of record. The most comprehensive K ¨oppen world map drawn from gridded data to date is that of Kottek et al. (2006) who presented a map with 31 climate types at a resolution of 0.5◦latitude by 0.5◦longitude based on both the CRU and Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) VASClimO v1.1 data sets for the period 1951–2000. All four maps based on gridded data are for restricted periods (1901–1995, 1961–1990 or 1951–2000) and any sub-grid resolution climate type variability has been obscured. So here we present an updated world map of the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate classification based on station data for the whole period of record. The data and methodology used to construct this map are described in the next section. Individual continental K ¨oppen-Geiger climate maps are presented and discussed. The continental maps are then combined to form the new world K ¨oppen-Geiger map, which is followed by a discussion, a link to the map for free download and a conclusion.",
    "method": "The philosophy behind the construction of this updated version of the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate map is to rely on observed data, rather than experience, wherever possible and minimise the number of subjective decisions. To this end, a large, globally extensive, climatic dataset was used to describe the observed climate and the methodology used to interpolate the observations was chosen to be simple and flexible, but not beyond what the data could support. There have been many modifications proposed to the K ¨oppen system but here we have used criteria that follow K ¨oppen’s last publication about his classification system in the K ¨oppen-Geiger Handbook (K¨oppen, 1936), with the exception of the boundary between the temperate (C) and cold (D) climates. We have followed Russell (1931) and used the temperature of the coldest month >0◦C, rather than >–3◦C as used by K ¨oppen in defining the temperate–cold climate boundary (see Wilcox, 1968 and Essenwanger, 2001 for a history of this modification). In the following analysis the complete period of record at each precipitation and temperature station is used. The stations exhibit a wide range of record lengths from a minimum of 30 values for each month up to 299 for precipitation and 297 for temperature. In Fig. 3, the percentage of stations with a monthly value is plotted over time and shows that the historical period that the data are most representative of are from 1909 to 1991 for precipitation and 1923 to 1993 for temperature. Spatially there is variation in the period of record covered, with Australia, Europe, Japan and the USA generally having the longest records. The whole-of-record approach assumes that data from one period is comparable with data from any other period. This assumption can be violated by global or local trends, like the recent observed warming of global surface temperature, largely attributable to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (Barnett et al., 2005). However, at the level of broad climate types (1st letter, see Table 1) the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate classification has been found to be relatively insensitive to temperature trends (Triantafyllou and Tsonis, 1994). The greatest sensitivity of the resultant map to climatic trends is likely to be in the transition zones between climate types, rather than within a climate type (as seen in Fraedrich et al., 2001). Any benefits of restricting the data to a common period would be achieved at the expense of spatial representativeness, since stations with data that did not sufficiently overlap the common period would have been excluded from the analysis. In using the complete period of record the resultant K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map presents the long-term climate type for the maximum number of locations around the world. A total of 4279 locations have data for both precipitation and temperature (indicated with an “x” in Fig. 2). At these locations the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type can be determined from the raw station data. Although an updated K¨oppen-Geiger map based on 4279 locations would be a significant improvement over earlier maps, considerable information would be lost if locations with only precipitation or temperature were ignored. To avoid this loss of information the precipitation and temperature based variables used in the criteria to determine the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type (see Table 1) were calculated at each precipitation and temperature station. Then each variable was interpolated using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension (Mitas and Mitasova, 1988) onto a 0.1 ×0.1 degree of latitude and longitude grid for each continent. The K¨oppen-Geiger criteria were then applied to the splined variables. The tension spline interpolations were performed in ESRI ArcMap version 9.1 using settings of “weight” = 1 and “points” = 10 for all interpolations. The chosen tension spline settings provided flexible and smooth interpolations of the climatic variables across the wide range of station densities and variable values experienced within and between continents. Although optimisation of the spline settings for each variable and continent may have improved the interpolation of individual climatic variables, it was not expected to significantly alter the final K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type maps (which is a combination of the variables) and so was not pursued in this paper. However, in continental sub-regions with high station density more flexible spline settings would have provided better local results. A potential improvement to the above methodology would be to apply a three-dimensional spline, using elevation as the third dimension (based on a digital elevation model like HYDRO1k, USGS, 2000). Elevation plays a key role in the observed spatial pattern of precipitation and temperature and is an important variable in the interpolation of precipitation and temperature fields (Daly, 2006). In this analysis long-term average climatic variables are interpolated, which display considerably less spatial variability than is typically observed in daily, monthly or even annual fields to which 3-D interpolation is usually applied. However, due to sparse station density, particularly in high elevation regions, a more complex 3-D interpolation procedure was not used in this paper. Another potential improvement would be to conduct cross-validation on the individual splined variables to investigate the sensitivity of each spline to the underlying data as well as cross-validation of the final K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map to assess the sensitivity of the map to each individual station. Such a sensitivity analysis would probably indicate that the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map is most sensitive in regions of low station density, transition zones between climate types and also in regions where there are large elevation differences. A cross-validation exercise was not conducted as part of this paper due to the considerable amount of time required for such an exercise. A description of the symbols and the criteria used to define the K¨oppen-Geiger climate types is provided in Table 1. The 30 possible climate types in Table 1 are divided into 3 tropical (Af, Am and Aw), 4 arid (BWh, BWk, BSh and BSk), 9 temperate (Csa, Csb, Csc, Cfa, Cfb, Cfc, Cwa, Cwb and Cwc), 12 cold (Dsa, Dsb, Dsc, Dsd, Dfa, Dfb, Dfc, Dfd, Dwa, Dwb, Dwc and Dwd) and 2 polar (ET and EF). All precipitation variables are in units of millimetres (mm) and all temperature variables are in units of degrees Celsius (◦C). Since all locations that satisfy the B climate criteria will also satisfy one of the other (A, C, D or E) climate criteria, the B climates must be identified first. The set of locations defined as having a B climate is based on a combination of mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. The sets of A, C, D and E climate locations are mutually exclusive and are based on temperature criteria only. In applying the criteria to the global dataset it became apparent that in some C climate locations it is possible to satisfy both the Cs and Cw criteria simultaneously. An example of this is Herberton Post Office (17.38S, 145.38E, elevation 900m) in North Queensland, Australia. Table 2 shows the monthly averages of precipitation and temperature for the Herberton Post Office record. Each average is based on about 105 monthly values for precipitation and 78 monthly values for temperature, so these averages are from a long-term station. Following the K ¨oppen-Geiger criteria in Table 1, summer is the period ONDJFM and over 70% of the mean annual precipitation falls during summer. Since the mean annual precipitation (1146mm) is larger than the B climate type precipitation threshold of 678mm (10*(2*19.9+28))(see Table 1) the station is not a B climate. With the coldest monthly temperature 15.5◦C, the station is not an A climate, but does satisfy the criteria for a C climate. When the second letter is allocated, the driest summer month is 25.3mm, which is below 40mm and is less than one third of the wettest winter month (86.0mm), so the station satisfies a Cs climate type. However, the driest winter month (16.5mm) is less than one tenth of the wettest summer month (238.4mm), so this station also satisfies the Cw climate type. Considering that over 70% of the precipitation falls during summer a classification of Cw is appropriate, while a classification of Cs is not. For cases such as Herberton Post Office an additional test was developed and applied to determine whether to use Cs or Cw at a given location. When a location satisfied both Cs and Cw criteria, the precipitation for the six months containing summer and the six months containing winter were compared, with Cw assigned if the summer precipitation was greater than the winter precipitation. This additional rule was also applied to locations that satisfied both the Ds and Dw climate criteria as well. In the presence of steep gradients of a variable, splines are known to over

or under-estimate, particularly if there is limited station density. Initially, these spline artefacts were ignored at the individual variable level. However, once a continental map of K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type was produced, the map was checked for locations where over or under-estimation in a splined variable had caused an aberrant climate type to be defined. These aberrant areas were generally found to be small and were patched by hand based on surrounding observations. Conversely, in some low station density regions, a climate type would extend further than expected due to a lack of observations to inform the spline. In these situations, discussed later, the climate type was left unmodified, due to a lack of information on which to base any corrections. Contrary to some earlier forms of the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map the concept of a high altitude climate type is not used in this paper. Designated as a separate 1st letter climate type H (Highland) or as a subcategory of the E climate type (ETH or EFH) the highland climate type requires elevation information to be defined. Although global elevation data are available, defining all locations above a specified elevation as an H climate provides little information about the climate at those locations relative to using the full suite of A, B, C, D and E climate types. Therefore no highland climate type is used in this paper. Once the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map for each continent was constructed, the percentage of land area covered by the major climate types was calculated. Since the area of a 0.1×0.1 degree pixel changes with latitude, a map of 0.1 ×0.1 degree pixel area was constructed and then projected onto a Cylindrical Equal Area projection of the world to determine the area (in km2) of each 0.1 ×0.1 degree pixel. These pixel areas were then summed for each climate type to provide an estimate of the land area covered by each climate type.",
  "result": "The K¨oppen-Geiger climate type map was determined using the methodology described in the previous section for each continent. Continental definitions used in this paper follow those used in the HYDRO1k DEM of the world (USGS, 2000). These maps are presented and discussed in this section.",
  "conclusion": "The updated world K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map is based on the climatology at stations over their entire period of record, with each variable individually interpolated and differs from the recent work of Kottek et al. (2006), which is based on 0.5 ×0.5 degree gridded temperature and precipitation data for the period 1951 to 2000. Although broadly similar to the map of Kottek et al. (2006), the present map also deals with locations that satisfy both Cs and Cw (or Ds and Dw) and has a finer resolution. The single setting used for the 2-D thin-plate spline with tension was able to successfully interpolate the observed data in the vast majority of cases. For a total of 4279 stations with both precipitation and temperature data, the map differs significantly at only 3 stations (Kodaikanal, Pune and Aracaju) and in each case a more flexible spline setting may have improved the map. However, in mountainous regions and in regions of low station density the addition of elevation into the interpolation procedure may improve the extrapolation of K¨oppen-Geiger climate type. In addition to improved estimates of precipitation and temperate in mountainous regions, elevation information would limit the influence of isolated high elevation stations extending their climate type into lowland regions. The electronic form (in ESRI Arc Grid (raster) and JPG formats) of the world K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map is available in the Supplementary Material section (http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/ hess-11-1633-2007-supplement.zip ). Also available at this site are files containing the precipitation and temperature variables for all stations used in the construction of the map."

This assumption can be violated by global or local trends, like the recent observed warming of global surface temperature, largely attributable to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (Barnett et al., 2005). However, at the level of broad climate types (1st letter, see Table 1) the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate classification has been found to be relatively insensitive to temperature trends (Triantafyllou and Tsonis, 1994). The greatest sensitivity of the resultant map to climatic trends is likely to be in the transition zones between climate types, rather than within a climate type (as seen in Fraedrich et al., 2001). Any benefits of restricting the data to a common period would be achieved at the expense of spatial representativeness, since stations with data that did not sufficiently overlap the common period would have been excluded from the analysis. In using the complete period of record the resultant K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map presents the long-term climate type for the maximum number of locations around the world. A total of 4279 locations have data for both precipitation and temperature (indicated with an “x” in Fig. 2). At these locations the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type can be determined from the raw station data. Although an updated K¨oppen-Geiger map based on 4279 locations would be a significant improvement over earlier maps, considerable information would be lost if locations with only precipitation or temperature were ignored. To avoid this loss of information the precipitation and temperature based variables used in the criteria to determine the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type (see Table 1) were calculated at each precipitation and temperature station. Then each variable was interpolated using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension (Mitas and Mitasova, 1988) onto a 0.1 ×0.1 degree of latitude and longitude grid for each continent. The K¨oppen-Geiger criteria were then applied to the splined variables. The tension spline interpolations were performed in ESRI ArcMap version 9.1 using settings of “weight” = 1 and “points” = 10 for all interpolations. The chosen tension spline settings provided flexible and smooth interpolations of the climatic variables across the wide range of station densities and variable values experienced within and between continents. Although optimisation of the spline settings for each variable and continent may have improved the interpolation of individual climatic variables, it was not expected to significantly alter the final K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type maps (which is a combination of the variables) and so was not pursued in this paper. However, in continental sub-regions with high station density more flexible spline settings would have provided better local results. A potential improvement to the above methodology would be to apply a three-dimensional spline, using elevation as the third dimension (based on a digital elevation model like HYDRO1k, USGS, 2000). Elevation plays a key role in the observed spatial pattern of precipitation and temperature and is an important variable in the interpolation of precipitation and temperature fields (Daly, 2006). In this analysis long-term average climatic variables are interpolated, which display considerably less spatial variability than is typically observed in daily, monthly or even annual fields to which 3-D interpolation is usually applied. However, due to sparse station density, particularly in high elevation regions, a more complex 3-D interpolation procedure was not used in this paper. Another potential improvement would be to conduct cross-validation on the individual splined variables to investigate the sensitivity of each spline to the underlying data as well as cross-validation of the final K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map to assess the sensitivity of the map to each individual station. Such a sensitivity analysis would probably indicate that the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map is most sensitive in regions of low station density, transition zones between climate types and also in regions where there are large elevation differences. A cross-validation exercise was not conducted as part of this paper due to the considerable amount of time required for such an exercise. A description of the symbols and the criteria used to define the K¨oppen-Geiger climate types is provided in Table 1. The 30 possible climate types in Table 1 are divided into 3 tropical (Af, Am and Aw), 4 arid (BWh, BWk, BSh and BSk), 9 temperate (Csa, Csb, Csc, Cfa, Cfb, Cfc, Cwa, Cwb and Cwc), 12 cold (Dsa, Dsb, Dsc, Dsd, Dfa, Dfb, Dfc, Dfd, Dwa, Dwb, Dwc and Dwd) and 2 polar (ET and EF). All precipitation variables are in units of millimetres (mm) and all temperature variables are in units of degrees Celsius (◦C). Since all locations that satisfy the B climate criteria will also satisfy one of the other (A, C, D or E) climate criteria, the B climates must be identified first. The set of locations defined as having a B climate is based on a combination of mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature. The sets of A, C, D and E climate locations are mutually exclusive and are based on temperature criteria only. In applying the criteria to the global dataset it became apparent that in some C climate locations it is possible to satisfy both the Cs and Cw criteria simultaneously. An example of this is Herberton Post Office (17.38S, 145.38E, elevation 900m) in North Queensland, Australia. Table 2 shows the monthly averages of precipitation and temperature for the Herberton Post Office record. Each average is based on about 105 monthly values for precipitation and 78 monthly values for temperature, so these averages are from a long-term station. Following the K ¨oppen-Geiger criteria in Table 1, summer is the period ONDJFM and over 70% of the mean annual precipitation falls during summer. Since the mean annual precipitation (1146mm) is larger than the B climate type precipitation threshold of 678mm (10*(2*19.9+28))(see Table 1) the station is not a B climate. With the coldest monthly temperature 15.5◦C, the station is not an A climate, but does satisfy the criteria for a C climate. When the second letter is allocated, the driest summer month is 25.3mm, which is below 40mm and is less than one third of the wettest winter month (86.0mm), so the station satisfies a Cs climate type. However, the driest winter month (16.5mm) is less than one tenth of the wettest summer month (238.4mm), so this station also satisfies the Cw climate type. Considering that over 70% of the precipitation falls during summer a classification of Cw is appropriate, while a classification of Cs is not. For cases such as Herberton Post Office an additional test was developed and applied to determine whether to use Cs or Cw at a given location. When a location satisfied both Cs and Cw criteria, the precipitation for the six months containing summer and the six months containing winter were compared, with Cw assigned if the summer precipitation was greater than the winter precipitation. This additional rule was also applied to locations that satisfied both the Ds and Dw climate criteria as well. In the presence of steep gradients of a variable, splines are known to overor under-estimate, particularly if there is limited station density. Initially, these spline artefacts were ignored at the individual variable level. However, once a continental map of K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type was produced, the map was checked for locations where over or under-estimation in a splined variable had caused an aberrant climate type to be defined. These aberrant areas were generally found to be small and were patched by hand based on surrounding observations. Conversely, in some low station density regions, a climate type would extend further than expected due to a lack of observations to inform the spline. In these situations, discussed later, the climate type was left unmodified, due to a lack of information on which to base any corrections. Contrary to some earlier forms of the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map the concept of a high altitude climate type is not used in this paper. Designated as a separate 1st letter climate type H (Highland) or as a subcategory of the E climate type (ETH or EFH) the highland climate type requires elevation information to be defined. Although global elevation data are available, defining all locations above a specified elevation as an H climate provides little information about the climate at those locations relative to using the full suite of A, B, C, D and E climate types. Therefore no highland climate type is used in this paper. Once the K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map for each continent was constructed, the percentage of land area covered by the major climate types was calculated. Since the area of a 0.1×0.1 degree pixel changes with latitude, a map of 0.1 ×0.1 degree pixel area was constructed and then projected onto a Cylindrical Equal Area projection of the world to determine the area (in km2) of each 0.1 ×0.1 degree pixel. These pixel areas were then summed for each climate type to provide an estimate of the land area covered by each climate type.",   "result": "The K¨oppen-Geiger climate type map was determined using the methodology described in the previous section for each continent. Continental definitions used in this paper follow those used in the HYDRO1k DEM of the world (USGS, 2000). These maps are presented and discussed in this section.",   "conclusion": "The updated world K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map is based on the climatology at stations over their entire period of record, with each variable individually interpolated and differs from the recent work of Kottek et al. (2006), which is based on 0.5 ×0.5 degree gridded temperature and precipitation data for the period 1951 to 2000. Although broadly similar to the map of Kottek et al. (2006), the present map also deals with locations that satisfy both Cs and Cw (or Ds and Dw) and has a finer resolution. The single setting used for the 2-D thin-plate spline with tension was able to successfully interpolate the observed data in the vast majority of cases. For a total of 4279 stations with both precipitation and temperature data, the map differs significantly at only 3 stations (Kodaikanal, Pune and Aracaju) and in each case a more flexible spline setting may have improved the map. However, in mountainous regions and in regions of low station density the addition of elevation into the interpolation procedure may improve the extrapolation of K¨oppen-Geiger climate type. In addition to improved estimates of precipitation and temperate in mountainous regions, elevation information would limit the influence of isolated high elevation stations extending their climate type into lowland regions. The electronic form (in ESRI Arc Grid (raster) and JPG formats) of the world K ¨oppen-Geiger climate type map is available in the Supplementary Material section (http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/ hess-11-1633-2007-supplement.zip ). Also available at this site are files containing the precipitation and temperature variables for all stations used in the construction of the map."   } }
