System prompt:
The total length of the content that I want to send you is too large to send in only one piece.
For sending you that content, I will follow this rule:

[START PART 1/10]
this is the content of the part 1 out of 10 in total
[END PART 1/10]

Then you just answer: "Received part 1/10"

And when I tell you "ALL PARTS SENT", then you can continue processing the data and answering my requests.

Instruction:
Extract the given sections (Introduction, Method, Result, Conclusion) from the research paper provided as the input.
For each "Introduction, Method, Result, Conclusion" section, include the extracted content in its "entirety" from start to end.
This should be extracted directly from the paper without any abbreviations or "..." for brevity. Each section should be at least 200 words. Don't summarize.
If a text for particular section is not present, output "Not specified".
The name of the section may not be exactly the same, but look at the content.
Organize the output in the given output JSON format.

Output:
