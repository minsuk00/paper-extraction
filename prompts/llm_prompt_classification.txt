Instruction:
Your objective is to classify the input text chunk into appropriate sections from a research paper.
The possible section names to choose from will be given as a list. CHOOSE FROM THIS LIST ONLY. You will be penalized for outputting a section that is not on the given list.
The "None" option is for when the other options don't match

As the entire paper is too long to send in one piece, I will split the content into parts and send them one by one.
Also, the classification result of the previous chunk will be given. Note that it is likely for a section to continue.
If you think the section changes within the input text, return the new section only.
I will also provide how many chunks there are in total, and which chunk is provided.
Use this information as well. Note that "Introduction" is likely to be in the beginning, and "Conclusion" is likely to towards the the end.

Output:
[The name of the section that was "chosen from the list"]

Possible sections to choose from:
```
{possible_sections}
```

Previous chunk classification result:
```
{previous_result}
```

Input chunk:
```
This is the {target_chunk_num}-th chunk out of {total_chunk_num} total chunks.

{input_chunk}
```
