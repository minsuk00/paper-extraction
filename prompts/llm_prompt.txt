Instruction:
Your objective is to extract the text of sections from the given research paper text input. You should detect all section names during the process.

Extract the text of sections (Introduction, Method, Result, Conclusion) from the given research paper. Look at the content to decide which section it belongs to.
You need to extract the FULL TEXT FROM START TO END OF THE SECTION directly from the paper. Do not summarize or use "..." for abbreviation. You will be penalized for not using text directly from the paper.
Try to capture the whole section. For reference, each section, on average, has the following length.
Introduction: 3 paragraphs (500 words or 650 tokens)
Method: 10 paragraphs (1100 words 1500 tokens)
Results: 9 paragraphs (900 words 1200 tokens)
Conclusion: 1 paragraphs (150 words 200 tokens)
(Note that you need to include all subsections within a section. e.g. "2.Method" section includes "2.1" and "2.2" subsections)

Organize the output in the given output JSON format.
Remember that the sections you need to extract text are: "Introduction", "Method", "Result", and "Conclusion". You NEED to include these in your output.
(Careful not to confuse Introduction with Abstract)

Output format:
{
  "filename": "[Title of the research paper]",
  "extracted-section-list": "[List of the all detected section names (list datatype)]",
  "target-section-extraction-result": {
      "introduction": [extracted text of Introduction section],
      "method": [extracted text of Method section],
      "result": [extracted text of Result section],
      "conclusion": [extracted text of Conclusion section],
