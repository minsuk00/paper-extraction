Then an additive bias is applied and the result is passed through a sigmoid function. Formally, the value of unit at position ( x, y) in the jth feature map in the ith layer, denoted as vxyij, is given by vxyij= tanh(bij+∑mPi−1∑p=0Qi−1∑q=0wpqijmv(x+p)(y+q)(i−1)m), where tanh( ·) is the hyperbolic tangent function, bij is the bias for this feature map, mindexes over the set of feature maps in the ( i−1)th layer connected to the current feature map, wpqijkis the value at the position ( p, q) of the kernel connected to the kth feature map, and PiandQiare the height and width of the kernel, respectively. In the subsampling layers, the resolution of the feature maps is reduced by pooling over local neighborhood on the feature maps in the previous layer, thereby increasing invariance to distortions on the inputs. A CNN architecture can be constructed by stacking multiple layers of convolution and subsampling in an alternating fashion. The parameters of CNN, such as the bias bijand the kernel weight wpqijk, are usually trained using either supervised or unsupervised approaches ( LeCun et al. ,1998; Ranzato et al. ,2007).\\n2.1. 3D Convolution\\nIn 2D CNNs, convolutions are applied on the 2D feature maps to compute features from the spatial dimensions only. When applied to video analysis problems, it is desirable to capture the motion information encoded in multiple contiguous frames. To this end, we propose to perform 3D convolutions in the convolution stages of CNNs to compute features from both spatial and temporal dimensions. The 3D convolution is achieved by convolving a 3D kernel to the cube formed by stacking multiple contiguous frames together. By this construction, the feature maps in the convolution layer is connected to multiple contiguous frames in the previous layer, thereby capturing motion information. Formally, the value at position ( x, y, z ) on the jth feature map in the ith layer is given by vxyzij=tanh(bij+∑mPi−1∑p=0Qi−1∑q=0Ri−1∑r=0wpqrijmv(x+p)(y+q)(z+r)(i−1)m), where Riis the size of the 3D kernel along the temporal dimension, wpqrijmis the ( p, q, r)th value of the kernel connected to the mth feature map in the previous layer. A comparison of 2D and 3D convolutions is given in Figure 1.\\n2.2. A 3D CNN Architecture\\nBased on the 3D convolution described above, a variety of CNN architectures can be devised. In the following, we describe a 3D CNN architecture that we have developed for human action recognition on the TRECVID data set. In this architecture shown in Figure 3, we consider 7 frames of size 60 ×40 centered on the current frame as inputs to the 3D CNN model. We first apply a set of hardwired kernels to generate multiple channels of information from the input frames. This results in 33 feature maps in the second layer in 5 different channels known as gray, gradient-x, gradient-y, optflow-x, and optflow-y. The gray channel contains the gray pixel values of the 7 input frames. The feature maps in the gradient-x and gradient-y channels are obtained by computing gradients along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, on each of the 7 input frames, and the optflow-x and optflow-y channels contain the optical flow fields, along the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, computed from adjacent input frames. This hardwired layer is used to encode our prior knowledge on features, and this scheme usually leads to better performance as c\"\n",
