    "introduction": "Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, which is thought to result from the effect of environmental factors in a genetically predisposed host. A gene location in the pericentromeric region of chromosome 16, IBD1, that contributes to susceptibility to Crohn’s disease has been established through multiple linkage studies1–6, but the specific gene(s) has not been identified. NOD2, a gene that encodes a protein with homology to plant disease resistance gene products is located in the peak region of linkage on chromosome 16 (ref. 7). Here we show, by using the transmission disequilibrium test and case-control analysis, that a frameshift mutation caused by a cytosine insertion, 3020insC, which is expected to encode a truncated NOD2 protein, is associated with Crohn’s disease. Wild-type NOD2 activates nuclear factor NF-kB, making it responsive to bacterial lipopolysaccharides; however, this induction was deficient in mutant NOD2. These results implicate NOD2 in susceptibility to Crohn’s disease, and suggest a link between an innate immune response to bacterial components and development of disease.",
    "method": "The 12-exon genomic organization of the NOD2 gene was determined by aligning the complementary DNA sequence(AF178930) with one genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, RPI11-327F22 (AC007728) (Fig. 1a). All coding exons and flanking introns were sequenced in 12 affected individuals from pure CD families with increased linkage scores at D16S3396, as well as in 4 case controls. In three CD patients, a cytosine insertion was observed in exon 11 at nucleotide 3020 (3020insC) (Fig. 1b). 3020insC resulted in a frameshift at the second nucleotide of codon 1007 (Fig. 1b), and a Leu1007 !Pro substitution in the tenth LRR, followed by a premature stop codon (Fig. 1c). The predicted truncated NOD2 protein contained 1,007 amino acids instead of the 1,040 amino acids of the wild-type NOD2 protein (Fig. 1d ). We used an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (Fig. 2) to type 3020insC in IBD families and case controls. Analysing only one CD patient per independent family, we observed preferential transmission (Table 1) from heterozygous parents to affected children of 3020insC (39 transmissions and 17 non-transmissions; P= 0.0046). Analysing all independent nuclear families by sib-TDT (ftp://lahmed.stanford.edu/pub/aspex/index.html), the empirical Pvalue was similar, P= 0.0007. As expected from linkage studies2,5, no preferential transmission of 3020insC was observed among families with ulcerative colitis (data not shown). As 365 of the 416 independent CD families have several affected individuals, the applicability of these associations to the more common, sporadic cases requires further study.",
    "result": "Additional support for association to CD was provided by case-control analysis, in which, using one CD individual per independent family, the 3020insC allele frequency among all CD groups was 8.2% (Table 2). The allele frequencies of 3020insC were comparable among Jewish (8.4%) and non-Jewish Caucasians (8.1%). Among case controls (Table 2), the allele frequency in four separate Caucasian cohorts of 4.0% was significantly lower than in CD patients ( P= 0.0018, by large-sample approximations to a two-sample binomial test). The allele frequency of the 3020insC among 182 unrelated ulcerative colitis patients was 3.0%, and was significantly lower than the frequency among CD patients ( P= 0.0010). The genotype frequencies of 3020insC in unrelated CD individuals were 11 homozygotes, 46 heterozygotes and 359 wild-type homozygotes. Among case controls, there were 23 heterozygous individuals, with the remaining being wild-type homozygotes. The genotype-relative risk (GRR) for heterozygous and homozygous 3020insC was 1.5 and 17.6, respectively, as compared with wild-type controls. Given its frequency, 3020insC is unlikely to account completely for the observed evidence of linkage at IBD1, and other variants of NOD2 may confer additional disease risk. For example, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NOD2 have been identified, 2722G ! C (Gly908Arg) and 2104C !T (Arg702Trp), which are highly associated with CD by the transmission disequilibrium test (data not shown). Furthermore, other susceptibility genes might also be present in this broad region of linkage on chromosome 16.",
    "conclusion": "Our studies implicate NOD2 in susceptibility to CD, and suggest a link between an innate response to bacterial components and development of disease."
