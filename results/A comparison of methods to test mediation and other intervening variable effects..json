Many different disciplines use such models, with the terminology, assumptions, and statistical tests only partially overlapping among them. In psychology, the X → I → Y relation is often termed mediation  (Baron & Kenny, 1986), sociology originally popularized the term indirect effect  (Alwin & Hauser, 1975), and in epidemiology, it is termed the surrogate  or intermediate endpoint effect  (Freedman & Schatzkin, 1992). This article focuses on the statistical performance of each of the available tests of the effect of an intervening variable. Consideration of conceptual issues related to the definition of intervening variable effects is deferred to the final section of the Discussion. Hypotheses articulating measurable processes that intervene between the independent and dependent variables have long been proposed in psychology (e.g., MacCorquodale & Meehl, 1948; Woodworth, 1928). Such hypotheses are fundamental to theory in many areas of basic and applied psychology (Baron & Kenny, 1986; James & Brett, 1984). Reflecting this importance, a search of the Social Science Citation Index  turned up more than 2,000 citations of the Baron and Kenny article that presented an important statistical approach to the investigation of these processes. Examples of hypotheses and models that involve intervening variables abound. In basic social psychology, intentions are thought to mediate the relation between attitude and behavior (Ajzen & Fish-bein, 1980). In cognitive psychology, attentional processes are thought to intervene between stimulus and behavior (Stacy, Leigh, & Weingardt, 1994 ). In industrial psychology, work environment leads to changes in the intervening variable of job perception, which in turn affects behavioral outcomes (James & Brett, 1984). In applied work on preventive health interventions, programs are designed to change proximal variables, which in turn are expected to have beneficial effects on the distal health outcomes of interest (Hansen, 1992; MacKinnon, 1994; West & Aiken, 1997). A search of psychological abstracts from 1996 to 1999 yielded nearly 200 articles with the term mediation, mediating , or intervening  in the title and many more articles that investigated the effects of intervening variables but did not use this terminology. Both experimental and observational studies were used to investigate processes involving intervening variables. An investigation of a subset of 50 of these articles found that the majority of studies examined one intervening variable at a time. Despite the number of articles proposing to study effects with intervening variables, fewer than a third of the subset included any test of significance of the intervening variable effect. Not surprisingly, the majority of studies that did conduct a formal test used Baron and Kenny's (1986) approach to testing for mediation. One explanation of the failure to test for intervening variable effects in two-thirds of the studies is that the methods are not widely known, particularly outside of social and industrial–organizational psychology. A less plausible explanation is that the large number of alternative methods makes it difficult for researchers to decide which one to use. Another explanation, described below, is that most tests for intervening variable effects have low statistical power.",       "method": "Our review located 14 different methods from a variety of disciplines that have been proposed to test path models involving intervening variables (see Table 1). Reflecting their diverse disciplinary origins, the procedures vary in their conceptual basis, the null hypothesis being tested, their assumptions, and statistical methods of estimation. This diversity of methods also indicates that there is no firm consensus across disciplines as to the definition of an intervening variable effect. Nonetheless, for convenience, these methods can be broadly conceptualized as reflecting three different general approaches. The first general approach, the causal steps approach, specifies a series of tests of links in a causal chain. This approach can be traced to the seminal work of Judd and Kenny (1981a,1981b) and Baron and Kenny (1986) and is the most commonly used approach in the psychological literature. The second general approach has developed independently in several disciplines and is based on the difference in coefficients such as the difference between a regression coefficient before and after adjustment for the intervening variable (e.g., Freedman & Schatzkin, 1992;McGuigan & Langholtz, 1988;Olkin & Finn, 1995). The difference in coefficients procedures are particularly diverse, with some testing hypotheses about intervening variables that diverge in major respects from what psychologists have traditionally conceptualized as mediation. The third general approach has its origins in sociology and is based on the product of coefficients involving paths in a path model (i.e., the indirect effect; Alwin & Hauser, 1975;Bollen, 1987;Fox, 1980;Sobel, 1982, 1988 ). In this article, we reserve the term mediational model  to refer to the causal steps approach of Judd and Kenny (1981a,1981b) and Baron and Kenny (1986) and use the term intervening variable  to refer to the entire set of 14 approaches that have been proposed. To date, there have been three statistical simulation studies of the accuracy of the standard errors of intervening variable effects that examined some of the variants of the product of coefficients and one difference in coefficients approach (MacKinnon & Dwyer, 1993; MacKinnon, Warsi, & Dwyer, 1995; Stone & Sobel, 1990). Two other studies included a small simulation to check standard error formulas for specific methods (Allison, 1995; Bobko & Rieck, 1980). No published study to date has compared all of the available methods within the three general approaches. In this article, we determine the empirical Type I error rates and statistical power for all available methods of testing effects involving intervening variables. Knowledge of Type I error rates and statistical power are critical for accurate application of any statistical test. A method with low statistical power will often fail to detect real effects that exist in the population. A method with Type I error rates that exceed nominal rates (e.g., larger than 5% for nominal alpha = .05) risks finding nonexistent effects. The variety of statistical tests of effects involving intervening variables suggests that they may differ substantially in terms of statistical power and Type I error rates. We first describe methods used to obtain point estimates of the intervening variable effect and then describe standard errors and tests of significance. The accuracy of the methods is then compared in a simulation study.",       "result": "In general, the simulation results for the binary case did not differ from those of the continuous independent variable case. Consequently, we present only the results for the continuous independent variable below. Intervening Variable Effect Estimates As found in other studies, most estimates of the intervening variable effect had minimal bias with the exception of zαzβ, which had substantial bias because the point estimates of this quantity were much larger than other point estimates of the intervening variable effect. Only the zαzβ test had bias greater than .01, even at a sample size of 50. Relative bias decreased as sample size and effect size increased for all estimates, including zαzβ. Accuracy of Standard Errors The accuracy of the formulas for standard errors of the intervening variable effect was examined by comparing the average estimate of the standard error of the intervening variable effect across the 500 simulations to the standard deviation of the intervening variable effect estimate from the 500 simulations. The standard deviation of the intervening variable effect across 500 simulations was the estimate of the true standard error (Yang & Robertson, 1986). Calculation of Empirical Power and Type I Error Rate Empirical power or Type I error rates as appropriate were calculated for each test of the intervening variable effect. We report results for the 5% level of significance because it is the most commonly used value in psychology. For each condition, the proportion of times that the intervening variable effect was statistically significant in 500 replications was tabulated. When α = 0, β = 0, or both α and β = 0, the proportion of replications in which the null hypothesis of no intervening variable effect was rejected provided an estimate of the empirical Type I error rate. Because we used the 5% significance level, the intervening variable effect was expected to be statistically significant in 25 (5%) of the 500 samples when the intervening variable effect equals zero. When both α and β did not equal zero, the proportion of times that each method led to the conclusion that the intervening variable effect was significant provided the measure of statistical power. The higher the proportion of times a method led to the conclusion to reject the false null hypothesis of no effect, the greater the statistical power. The 14 procedures reference different statistical distributions. In each case, we used the critical values from the reference distribution for the test. For those tests based on asymptotic methods, we used 1.96 from the normal distribution. For the z’ = αβ/σαβ test we used critical values described in MacKinnon et al. (1998) indicated by z’, and for the test for P = zαzβ we used critical values from Craig (1936) indicated by P. The upper and lower confidence limits for the asymmetric confidence limits test were taken from the tabled values in Meeker et al. (1981) . The causal steps tests involve multiple hypothesis tests so there is no single reference distribution. For these tests, the intervening variable effect was considered significant if each of the steps was satisfied.",       "conclusion": "Tests of the intervening variable effect are useful because they examine processes by which variables are related. In clinical and community research, such tests are critical for the elucidation of how prevention and treatment programs work. In experimental research, such tests are critical for establishing the plausibility of causal sequences implied by theory. Reflecting the lack of consensus in the definition of an intervening effect across disciplines, the available tests address several different null hypotheses. The available procedures also differ in the extent to which they simply test whether the data are consistent with a hypothesized intervening variable model versus attempt to establish other logical features that support causal inference by ruling out other competing models. As a result of these differing conceptual bases, different assumptions, and different estimation methods, the available tests show large differences in their Type I error rates and statistical power. The present article provides researchers with more information about both the conceptual bases and the statistical performance of the available procedures for determining the statistical significance of an intervening variable effect. Our hope is that researchers will now have guidance in selecting a test of the intervening variable effect that addresses their question of interest with the maximal statistical performance."   } }
