It should begin with science and end with a settlement. — Oscar Wilde, An Ideal Husband\n1.1 The Demand for Information on Opinions and Sentiment\n“What other people think” has always been an important piece of information for most of us during the decision-making process. Long before awareness of the World Wide Web became widespread, many of us asked our friends to recommend an auto mechanic or to explain who they were planning to vote for in local elections, requested reference letters regarding job applicants from colleagues, or consulted Consumer Reports to decide what dishwasher to buy. But the Internet and the Web have now (among other things) made it possible to find out about the opinions and experiences of those in the vast pool of people that are neither our personal acquaintances nor well-known professional critics — that is, people we have never heard of. And conversely, more and more people are making their opinions available to strangers via the Internet.\n12Introduction\nIndeed, according to two surveys of more than 2000 American adults each [63, 127],\n•81% of Internet users (or 60% of Americans) have done online research on a product at least once;\n•20% (15% of all Americans) do so on a typical day;\n•among readers of online reviews of restaurants, hotels, and various services (e.g., travel agencies or doctors), between73% and 87% report that reviews had a significant influence on their purchase;\n1\n•consumers report being willing to pay from 20% to 99% more for a 5-star-rated item than a 4-star-rated item (the variances stems from what type of item or service is considered);\n•32% have provided a rating on a product, service, or person via an online ratings system, and 30% (including 18% of online senior citizens) have posted an online comment or review regarding a product or service.\n2\nWe hasten to point out that consumption of goods and services is not the only motivation behind people’s seeking out or expressing opinions online. A need for political information is another important factor. For example, in a survey of over 2500 American adults, Rainie and Horrigan [248] studied the 31% of Americans — over 60 million people — that were 2006 campaign internet users, defined as those who gathered information about the 2006 elections online and exchanged views via email. Of these,\n•28% said that a major reason for these online activities was to get perspectives from within their community, and 34% said that a major reason was to get perspectives from outside their community;\n•27% had looked online for the endorsements or ratings of external organizations;\n1Section 6.1 discusses quantitative analyses of actual economic impact, as opposed to consumer perception.\n2Interestingly, Hitlin and Rainie [123] report that “Individuals who have rated something online are also more skeptical of the information that is available on the Web.”1.1 The Demand for Information on Opinions and Sentiment 3\n•28% said that most of the sites they use share their point of view, but 29% said that most of the sites they use challenge their point of view, indicating that many people are not simply looking for validations of their pre-existing opinions; and\n•8% posted their own political commentary online.\nThe user hunger for and reliance upon online advice and recommendations that the data above reveals is merely one reason behind the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. But, Horrigan [127] reports that while a majority of American internet users report positive experiences during online product research, at the same time, 58% also report that online information was missing, impossible to find, confusing, and/or overwhelming. Thus, there is a clear need to aid consumers of products and of information by building better information-access systems than are currently in existence.\nThe interest that individual users show in online opinions about products and services, and the potential influence such opinions wield, is something that vendors of these items are paying more and more attention to [124]. The following excerpt from a whitepaper is illustrative of the envisioned possibilities, or at the least the rhetoric surrounding the possibilities:\nWith the explosion of Web 2.0 platforms such as blogs, discussion forums, peer-to-peer networks, and various other types of social media . . . consumers have at their disposal a soapbox of unprecedented reach and power by which to share their brand experiences and opinions, positive or negative, regarding any product or service. As major companies are increasingly coming to realize, these consumer voices can wield enormous influence in shaping the opinions of other consumers — and, ultimately, their brand loyalties, their purchase decisions, and their own brand advocacy. . . . Companies can respond to the consumer insights they generate through social media monitoring and analysis by modifying their 4Introduction marketing messages, brand positioning, product development, and other activities accordingly. — Zabin and Jeffries [327]\nBut industry analysts note that the leveraging of new media for the purpose of tracking product image requires new technologies; here is a representative snippet describing their concerns:\nMarketers have always needed to monitor media for information related to their brands — whether it’s for public relations activities, fraud violations, 3 or competitive intelligence. But fragmenting media and changing consumer behavior have crippled traditional monitoring methods. Technorati estimates that 75,000 new blogs are created daily, along with 1.2 million new posts each day, many discussing consumer opinions on products and services. Tactics [of the traditional sort] such as clipping services, field agents, and ad hoc research simply can’t keep pace. — Kim [154]\nThus, aside from individuals, an additional audience for systems capable of automatically analyzing consumer sentiment, as expressed in no small part in online venues, are companies anxious to understand how their products and services are perceived.",       "method": "One way in which this connection is made manifest in single-document opinion-oriented summarization is as follows: there are approaches that create textual sentiment summaries based on extraction of sentences or similar text units. For example, Beineke et al. [33] attempt to select a single passage that reflects the opinion of the document’s author(s), mirroring the practice of film advertisements that present “snippets” from reviews of the movie. Training and test data is acquired from the website Rotten Tomatoes, which provides a roughly sentence-length snippet for each review. However, Beineke et al. [33] note that low accuracy can result even for high-quality extraction methods because the Rotten Tomatoes data includes only a single snippet per review, whereas several sentences might be perfectly viable alternatives. In terms of creating longer summaries, Mao and Lebanon [200] suggest that by tracking the sentiment flow within a document — i.e., how sentiment orientation changes from one sentence to the next, as discussed in Section 4.7 — one can create sentiment summaries by choosing the sentences at local extrema of the flow (plus the first and last sentence). An interesting feature of this approach is that by incorporating a document’s flow, the technique takes into account the entire document in a holistic way. Both approaches just mentioned seek to select the absolutely most important sentences to present. Alternatively, one could simply extract all subjective sentences, as was done by Pang and Lee [232] to create “subjectivity extracts.” They suggested that these extracts could be used as summaries, although, as mentioned above, they focused on the use of these extracts as an aid to downstream polarity classification, rather than as summaries per se. Finally, we note that sentences are also used in multi-document sentiment summarization as well, as described in Section 5.2.",       "result": "In most of the studies cited above, the orientation of a review was derived from an explicit rating indication such as number of stars, but a few studies applied manual or automatic sentiment classification to review text [13, 14, 35, 47, 67, 68, 214, 237]. At least one related set of studies claims that “the text of the reviews contains information that influences the behavior of the consumers, and that the numeric ratings alone cannot capture the information in the text” [106] — see also Ghose et al. [107], who additionally attempt to assign a “dollar value” to various adjective-noun pairs, adverb-verb pairs, or similar lexical configurations. In a related vein, Pavlou and Dimoka [237] suggest that “the apparent success of feedback mechanisms to facilitate transactions among strangers does not mainly come from their crude numerical ratings, but rather from their rich feedback text comments.” Also, Chevalier and Mayzlin [59] interpret their findings on the effect of review length as providing some evidence that people do read the reviews rather than simply relying on numerical ratings.",       "conclusion": "Our goal in this survey has been to cover techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems, and to convey to the reader a sense of our excitement about the intellectual richness and breadth of the area. We very much encourage the reader to take up the many open challenges that remain, and hope we have provided some resources that will prove helpful in this regard."   } }
