A variety of DNA fingerprinting techniques is presently available (1-11), most of which use PCR for detection of fragments. The choice of which fingerprinting technique to use, is dependent on the application e.g. DNA typing, DNA marker mapping and the organism under investigation e.g. prokaryotes, plants, animals, humans. Ideally, a fingerprinting technique should require no prior investments in terms of sequence analysis, primer synthesis or characterization of DNA probes. A number of fingerprinting methods which meet these requirements have been developed over the past few years, including random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD; 8), DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF; 9) and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR; 10, 11). These methods are all based on the amplification of random genomic DNA fragments by arbitrarily selected PCR primers. DNA fragment patterns may be generated of any DNA without prior sequence knowledge. The patterns generated depend on the sequence of the PCR primers and the nature of the template DNA. PCR is performed at low annealing temperatures to allow the primers to anneal to multiple loci on the DNA. DNA fragments are generated when primer binding sites are within a distance that allows amplification. In principle, a single primer is sufficient for generating band patterns. These new PCR based fingerprinting methods have the major disadvantage that they are very sensitive to the reaction conditions, DNA quality and PCR temperature profiles (12-16), which limits their application. This paper describes a new technique for DNA fingerprinting, named AFLP. The AFLP technique is based on the detection of genomic restriction fragments by PCR amplification, and can be used for DNAs of any origin or complexity. Fingerprints are produced without prior sequence knowledge using a limited set of generic primers. The number of fragments detected in a single reaction can be 'tuned' by selection of specific primer sets. The AFLP technique is robust and reliable because stringent reaction conditions are used for primer annealing: the reliability of the RFLP technique (17, 18) is combined with the power of the PCR technique (19-21). This paper describes several features of the AFLP technique and illustrates how the technique can best be used in fingerprinting of genomic DNAs.",       "method": "DNAs, enzymes and materials Lambda DNA was purchased from Pharmacia (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Autographa californica Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus DNA (AcNPV) was a kind gift from Dr Just Vlak, Department of Virology, Agricultural University of Wageningen, The Netherlands, and was isolated as described previously (22). Acinetobacter DNA was a kind gift from Dr Paul Jansen, Department of Microbiology, University of Gent, Belgium, and was isolated from strain LMG 10554 according to the procedure of Pitcher et al. (23). Yeast DNA was isolated from strain AB1380 as described by Green and Olson with minor modifications (24). Tomato DNA (culture variety [cv] Moneymaker, obtained from Dr Maarten Koomneef, University of Wageningen, The Netherlands), Arabidopsis DNA (Recombinant Inbred Line 240, obtained from Dr Caroline Dean, John Innes Center, Norwich, UK), maize DNA (strain B73, obtained from Dr Mario Motto, Instituto Sperimentale per La, Bergamo, Italy), cucumber DNA (cv Primera, obtained from De Ruiter Seeds C.V., Bleiswijk, The Netherlands), barley DNA (cv Ingrid, obtained from Dr Paul Schulze-Lefert, University of Aachen, Germany), lettuce DNA (cv Calmar, obtained from Dr Richard Michelmore, UC Davis, Davis, CA, USA) and brassica DNA (oil seed rape, cv Major, obtained from Dr Thomas Osborn, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA) were isolated using a modified CTAB procedure described by Stewart and Via (25). Human DNA was prepared as described by Miller et al. (26) from a 100 ml blood sample of Mrs Marjo Bleeker, one of the co-authors of this paper. All restriction enzymes were purchased from Pharmacia (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB, Uppsala, Sweden), except for the restriction enzyme MseI, which was purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA). T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were also obtained from Pharmacia (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology AB, Uppsala, Sweden). All PCR reagents and consumables were obtained from Perkin Elmer Corp. (Norwalk, CT, USA). All radioactive reagents were purchased from Amersham (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) or Isotopchim (Isotopchim SA, Ganagobie, France). AFLP primers and adapters All oligonucleotides were made on a Biotronic Synostat D DNA-synthesizer (Eppendorf Gmbh, Maintal, Germany) or Milligen Expedite 8909 DNA-synthesizer (Mllipore Corp. Bedford, MA, USA). The quality of the crude oligonucleotides was detmined by end-labeling with polynucleotide kinase and [y.32P]ATP and subsequent electrophoresis on 18% denatring polyacrylamide gels (27). Oligonucleotides were generally used as adapters and primers for AFLP analysis without further purification. AFLP adapters consist of a core sequence and an enzyme-specific sequence (28). The structure of the EcoRI-adapter is: 5-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC CATCTGACGCATGGTTAA-5 The structure of the MseI-adapter is: 5-GACGATGAGTCCTGAG TACTCAGGACTCAT-5 Adapters for other 'rare cutter' enzymes were identical to the EcoRI-adapter with the exception that cohesive ends were used, which are compatible with these other enzymes. The TaqI-adapter was identical to the MseI-adapter with the exception that a cohesive end was used compatible with TaqI. AFLP primers consist of three parts, a core sequence, an enzyme specific sequence (ENZ) and a selective extension (EXT) (28). This is illustrated below for EcoRI- and MseI-primers with three selective nucleotides (selective nucleotides shown as NNN): CORE ENZ EcoRI 5-GACTGCGTACCAATTC MseI 5-GATGAGTCCTGAG TAA EXT NNN-3 NNN-3 AFLP-primers for other 'rare cutter' enzymes were similar to the EcoRI-primers, and TaqI-primers were similar to the MseI- primers, but have enzyme-specific parts corresponding to the respective enzymes. Moditiation of DNA and tenplate preparation The protocol below describes the generation of templates for AFLP reactions using the enzyme combination EcoRiI MseI. DNA templates with other restriction enzymes were prd using essentially the same protocol, except for the use of different restriction enzymes and corresponding double-stranded adapters. Genomic DNA (0.5,g) was incubated -for 1h at 37°C with 5U EcoRI and 5U MseI in 40gl 10mM Tris-HAcpH7.5, 10mM MgAc, 50mM KAc, 5mM DTT, 50ng/jl BSA.

Adapters were prepared by adding equimioaramiuntsof both strands; adapters were not phosphorylatbd. After ligation, the reaction mixture was diluted to 500gl witI 10mnM Tris-HCl, 0.1I mM EDTA pH 8.0, and stored at -20'C.

The PCR conditions differed depending on;hnamue offie selecive extensions off the AFRP primers used for amplification. AFLPrcions with primers having none or a single seltve nucleotide were performed for 20 cycles with the following cycle profile: a 30s DNA denaturation step at 94°C, a 1 min annealing step at 560C, and a 1 min extension step at 72°0C. AFLPretions with pimes having two or tr selective nucleotides were performed for 36 cycles with the following cycle profile: a 30s DNA denatation step at 940C, a 30s annaling step (see below), and a 1 min extension step at 72°C.

The first stethis mfiprocedure, named preamplification, was med with two AFLP primers having a single selective nucleotide as described above, with the exception that 30ng of both AFLP primers was used, and that these primers were not radioactively labeled. After this preamplification step, the reaction mixtures were diluted 10-fold with 10mM Tris-HCl, 0.1mM EDTA pH 8.0, and used Nucleic Acids Research, 1995, Vol. 23, No. 214409 rgstrlcion fragment AATTCCAC rTCGTGGTO AGCAAT + adaptor ligation 22bp coommon_qw 19bpcow CTCOTAGACTGCTACCAATTrcACTCOtTTATCAOGACTCATrCATCTGACGCATGGTTAA TG GCAATGAGTrCcGAGTAGCAG ashIbm+ AFLPpXGACTGCGTACCAATTCAGAGCATCTGACGCATGGTTAAA-GCAATGAG6TCCTGAGTAGCAG CTCGTAGACTGCGTACCAAT TCCAC-4rTTACTCAGGACTCATCGTC--N&ATGAGTCCTGAGTAGItAFIPpdmw amplification Figure1.SchematicrepresentationoftheAFLPtechnique.Top:EcoRI-MseI restrictionfragmentwithits5'protudingends.Center:thesamefragmentafter ligationoftheEcoRIandMseIadapters.Bottom:bothstrandsofthefragment withtheircorrespondingAFLPprimers.The3'endoftheprimersandtheir recognitionsequenceintheEcoRI-MseIfragmentarehighlighted. astemplatesforthesecondamplificationreaction.Thesecond amplificationreactionwasperformedasdescribedabovefor AFLPreactionswithprimershavinglongerselectiveextensions. Gel analysis Following amplification reaction products were mixed with an equal volume (20,u) of formamide dye (98% formamide, 10mM EDTApH8.0, and bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol as tracking dyes). The resulting mixtures were heated for 3min at 900C, and then quickly cooled on ice. Each sample (2gl) was loaded on a 5% denaturing (sequencing) polyacrylamide gel (27). The gel matrix was prepared using 5% acrylamide, 0.25% methylenebisacryl, 7.5M urea in 50mM Tris/50mM Boric acid/I mM EDTA. To 100ml of gel solution 500gl of 10% APS and 100 gl TEMED was added and gels were cast using a SequiGen 38x 50cm gel apparatus (BioRad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). 100mM Tris/100mM Boric acid/2mM EDTA was used as running buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at constant power, 110W, for -2h. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed for 30min in 10% acetic acid dried on the glass plates and exposed to Fuji phosphoimage screens for 16h. Fingerprint patterns were visualized using a Fuji BAS-2000 phosphoimage analysis system (Fuji Photo Film Company Ltd, Japan).",       "result": "Principle of the method The AFLP technique is based on the amplification of subsets of genomic restriction fragments using PCR. DNA is cut with restriction enzymes, and double-stranded (ds) adapters are ligated to the ends of the DNA-fragments to generate template DNA for amplification. The sequence of the adapters and the adjacent restriction sites serve as primer binding sites for subsequent amplification of the restriction fragments (Fig.1). Selective nucleotides are included at the 3' ends of the PCR primers, which therefore can only prime DNA synthesis from a subset of the restriction sites. Only restriction fragments in which the nucleo- tides flanking the restriction site match the selective nucleotides will be amplified (Fig.1). The restriction fragments for amplification are generated by two restriction enzymes, a rare cutter and a frequent cutter.

Thelossofselectivitywithprimershavingfourselectivebasesis illustratedbytheamplificationofnumerousbandsnotdetected inthecorrespondingfingerprintswithprimershavingthree selectivebases(comparelanesDwithlanesC).Thisindicatesthe toleranceofmismatchesintheamplificationofthefragments usingAFLPprimerswithfour-baseextensions.Itismostlikely thatmismatcheswillbetoleratedatthefirstselectivebase, becausethisnucleotideispositionedmostdistantfromthe3'end, andbecausetheselectivityofthree-baseselectiveextensionswas stilladequate.Otherresearchershavealsoinvestigatedthe selectivityofthe3'nucleotidesofPCRprimers(41,42).They havefoundthatmismatchesweretoleratedatboththe3'ultimate andpenultimatenucleotidesofPCRprimers,whichisinconflict withourfindings.Inotherexperiments,wehavefoundthat primerselectivityisrelativeandalsodependsonthenumberof fragmentsamplifiedinasinglereaction,thePCRconditionsand theprimerdesign(resultsnotshown).Wefeelthatsomelevelof mismatchamplificationwillalwaysoccur,butthatthereaction conditionscanpreventthesemismatchbandstoreachthe 4412NucleicAcidsResearch,1995,Vol.23,No.21 detectionlevel.This,presumably,isthemajordifferencewith previouslyreportedexperiments(41,42).

This hypothesis is supported by our finding that comparison of a number of individual AFLP fingerprints obtained with only 2.5 pg of template DNA showed high variation in the intensity of the individual bands (results not shown). A remarkable characteristic of the AFLP reaction is that generally the labeled primer is completely consumed (the unlabeled primer is in excess), and that therefore the amplification reaction stops when the labeled primer is exhausted. We have also found that further thermocycling does not affect the band pattern once the labeled primer is consumed (results not shown). This characteristic is elegantly utilized in the AFLP protocol, which uses an excess of PCR cycles, which will result in fingerprints of equal intensity despite of variations in template concentration. We have also noted that DNA fingerprints tend to be unreliable if the template concentration was below a certain absolute concentration (-1 pg), regardless of the complexity of the DNA (results not shown). In the latter case, bands were observed which were template independent and which were also present if no DNA was added. The use of other restriction enzyme combinations for AFLP fingerprinting of complex genomes was also investigated (results not shown). These enzyme combinations included EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, BglII, XbaI and Sse8387I (eight base cutter) in combination with either MseI or TaqI. Fingerprints were generated on a variety of plant and animal DNAs. The use of TaqI as a four-base cutter instead of MseI resulted in an unequal distribution of the amplified fragments, which were mainly present in the upper part of the gel. Most eukaryotic DNAs are AT-rich, and as a result MseI (recognition sequence TTAA) will generally produce much smaller restriction fragments compared with TaqI (recognition sequence TCGA). MseI is therefore preferred for AFLP fingerprinting because it cuts very frequently in most eukaryotic genomes yielding fragments that are in the optimal size range for both PCR amplification and separation on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Other rare cutter enzymes generally performed equal to EcoRI in AFLP fingerprinting, and the number of bands obtained reflected the cleavage frequency of the various restriction enzymes. However, EcoRI is preferred because it is a reliable (low cost) six-cutter enzyme, which limits problems associated with partial restriction in AFLP fingerprinting (see below). Incomplete restriction of the DNA will cause problems in AFLP fingerprinting, because partial fragments will be generated, which will be detected by the AFLP procedure. When various DNA samples of the same organism are compared with AFLP fingerprinting, incomplete restriction will result in the detection of differences in band patterns, which do not reflect true DNA polymorphisms, i.e. when one sample is partially restricted and the others are not. Incomplete restriction will only become apparent when different DNA samples of the same organism are compared. It is characterised by the presence of additional bands in the lanes, predominantly of higher molecular weight.",   "conclusion": "AFLP is a DNA fingerprinting technique that detects genomic restriction fragments and resembles in that respect the RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) technique, with the major difference that PCR amplification instead of Southern hybridisation is used for detection of restriction fragments. The resemblance with the RFLP technique was the basis to choose the name AFLP. The name AFLP, however, should not be used as an acronym, because the technique will display presence or absence of restriction fragments rather than length differences. In our initial AFLP protocols an additional purification step was incorporated in the template preparation (28). Biotinylated EcoRI-adapters were used for ligation, and subsequently the biotinylated DNA fragments (EcoRI-MseI fragments and EcoRI-EcoRI fragments) were substracted from the ligation mixture using streptavidin beads (28, 44). This step reduced the complexity of the DNA template by removing all MseI-MseI fragments, which proved to be important for generating high quality fingerprints of complex DNAs. The protocol described in this paper omits this purification step, because amplification conditions are used which result in preferential amplification of EcoRI-MseI fragments with respect to the MseI-MseI fragments (Fig.3). This is the result of careful adapter and primer design and inherent characteristics of the AFLP amplification reaction. The AFLP technique will generate fingerprints of any DNA regardless of the origin or complexity, and in this paper we have presented AFLP fingerprints of DNAs differing in genome size as much as 100000-fold. We have described that the number of amplified fragments may be controlled by the cleavage frequency of the rare cutter enzyme and the number of selective bases. In addition, the number of amplified bands may be controlled by the nature of the selective bases; selective extensions with rare di- or trinucleotides will result in the reduction of amplified fragments. In general, there is an almost linear correlation between numbers of amplified fragments and genome size. This linear correlation is lost in the complex genomes of higher plants, which contain high numbers of repeated sequences and, hence, multicopy restriction fragments. Fingerprints of these complex DNAs consist predominantly of unique AFLP fragments, but are characterised by the presence of small numbers of more intense repeated fragments. In complex genomes the number of restriction fragments that may be detected by the AFLP technique is virtually unlimited. A single enzyme combination (a combination of a specific six-base and four-base restriction enzyme) will already permit the amplification of 100000s of unique AFLP fragments, of which generally 50-100 are selected for each AFLP reaction. Most AFLP fragments correspond to unique positions on the genome, and, hence, can be exploited as landmarks in genetic and physical maps, each fragment being characterized by its size and its primers required for amplification. In addition, the AFLP technique permits detection of restriction fragments in any background or complexity, including pooled DNA samples and cloned (and pooled) DNA segments. Therefore, the AFLP technique is not simply a fingerprinting technique, it is an enabling technology in genome research, because it can bridge the gap between genetic and physical maps. First, the AFLP technique is a very effective tool to reveal restriction fragment polymorphisms. These fragment polymorphisms, i.e. AFLP markers, can be used to construct high density genetic maps of genomes or genome segments. In most organisms AFLP will prove to be the most effective way to construct genetic DNA marker maps compared to other existing marker technologies. Secondly, the AFLP markers can be used to detect corresponding genomic clones, e.g. yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs). This is most effectively achieved by working with libraries, which are pooled to allow for rapid PCR screening and subsequent clone identification. An AFLP marker will detect a single corresponding YAC clone in pools of as much as 100 YAC clones (M. Zabeau, M. Kuiper and P. Vos., manuscript in preparation). Finally, the AFLP technique may be used for fingerprinting of cloned DNA segments like cosmids, P1 clones, bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or YACs (results not shown). By simply using no or few selective nucleotides, restriction fragment fingerprints will be produced, which subsequently can be used to line up individual clones and make contigs.
